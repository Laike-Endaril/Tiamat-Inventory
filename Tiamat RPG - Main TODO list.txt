Attributes...
If the hotspot were defined as...
...an optimal distance
...an effective deviation
...a optimal multiplier, for damage at the optimal distance
...a non-optimal multiplier, for damage outside the effective area (effective area being optimal distance +/- effective deviation)
...a mode, which can either be...
1. Uses optimal multiplier if the attack hits anywhere within effective area, and non-optimal multiplier anywhere else
2. Uses optimal multiplier only at optimal distance, and fades from that to the non-optimal multiplier as you approach the near- and far- boundaries of the effective area

This would use 5 very specific attributes, be pretty flexible, and make it so that eg. if you had an attack which swings in a larger arc due to holding the weapon closer to the pommel, it could alter only the optimal distance without messing up the other attributes
