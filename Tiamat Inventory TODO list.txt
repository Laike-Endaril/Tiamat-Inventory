Implement swap
When unsheathed, the active weaponset should be in hands and the other...well...not in hands, and the active weaponset tiamat slots should be empty
When swapping, swap the tiamat slots if sheathed, and if unsheathed, swap the in-hand items with weaponset 2 slots (the "inactive" weaponset)

Make auto-pickup only pickup to vanilla mainhand and offhand?
Make sure to account for 2H items!
