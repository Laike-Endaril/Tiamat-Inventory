Change or add left click, right click keybinds "mainhand" and "offhand"



Add boolean config
"Tiamat attacks in creative mode" t/f
So a client can choose whether the first mainhand / offhand slot act in tiamat or vanilla mode when in creative gamemode



Stat balance
Attacks/skills/spells have unique, definable formulas



Should the custom inventory slots...
...be added to the vanilla inventory?
...be in a custom inventory which replaces the vanilla inventory?
...be in a custom inventory separate from the vanilla inventory (current setup)?
Maybe see how baubles is doing it
